# basketball-stats-tool

This program takes in a list of teams and players as input. The program cleans up the player data and then organizes the players into equal teams for the upcoming basketball season.

In this program I applied my knowledge of built-in Python data types like lists and dictionaries and combined these types to create structures to store and organize a team of Basketball players into distributed teams. This tool balances the teams by the total number of players and also generates some statistics for a given team.
